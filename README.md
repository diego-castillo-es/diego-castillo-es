**Backend Systems Researcher & Software Developer** from Spain  
I explore the intersection of software engineering, distributed systems, and scalable backend design.

### Research Interests

- High-performance backend architectures
- Observability and performance benchmarking in distributed systems
- Message queues, streaming systems, and event-driven design
- Experimental design for systems performance (load testing, profiling, etc.)
- Cloud-native backend infrastructure, CI/CD, and containerized deployments

I’m interested in research-driven backend development — where **engineering meets experimentation**.

### My work focuses on:

- **Performance benchmarking** of backend services (e.g., REST APIs, background workers)
- Studying the impact of **threading models**, **resource constraints**, and **I/O strategies** in JVM-based services
- Designing **scalable, observable architectures** using modern tools like **Spring Boot**, **Kafka**, **Prometheus**, and **Docker**
- Comparing patterns such as **event-driven** vs. **request/response** systems in high-load environments
- Building reproducible experiments and **custom instrumentation**

I treat backend systems as **living experiments** — not just to make them faster, but to understand **why** they behave the way they do under stress, scale, or failure.

I’m especially passionate about bringing the mindset of **research** into everyday software engineering: hypothesis, measurement, iteration.
